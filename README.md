# gl.shadermappings

Max has quite a few shaders build into the application. But if you want to patch with them you have to type `jit.gl.slab @file <shaderfile>` which is usually quite a hassle. Also you have to remember what the shader file name is. This simple objectmappings file will do all this work for you. How it works:

1. See all the shaderfiles in the autocomplete field when typing `jit.gl.`
2. Select the shaderfile and it will translate to `jit.gl.slab @file <shaderfile>`
